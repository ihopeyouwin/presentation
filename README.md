### Presentation
Your task is to prepare a presentation on a given topic (offered or approved by your mentor). The whole list of appropriate topics can be found [here](presentation-topics.md).

Requirements:
* 8 - 10 minutes for the presentation
* Talk rehearsal within your subgroup is mandatory
* Speaker notes for each slide are mandatory
* Language - English.

**You have to use The HTML Presentation Framework  - [Reveal](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/)** for your slides.
**Usage of https://slides.com/ is forbidden**

### Passing the task
   1. Record your speech (reminder that it has to be in English) on your phoneâ€™s camera. Your face has to be in the shot, while the slides don't necessarily have to be in it. Here's a good example - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JezLAu4751Y&feature=youtu.be;
  2. Upload the resulting video to your YouTube account. You can set the *unlisted* property for your video if you wish for no one else to see it(unless they get provided a link to the video);
  3. Add a link to your slides in the video description;
  4. Create a "presentation" branch in your private repository. Next up, create a markdown file named "presentation.md" and fill it with: 
     - A link to your YouTube video;
     - A link to your Reveal presentation;
     - A link to the transcript of your presentation;
     - Your comments (optional);  

  Create a PR, add your mentor to it.
